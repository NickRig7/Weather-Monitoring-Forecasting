# Weather-Monitoring-Forecasting
A portable weather monitoring system to collect weather data, further using the raw to analyze and forecast the weather. Weather monitoring systems have become increasingly
important over the years due to the impact of changing weather patterns on various aspects of our lives. These systems use sensors to measure various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction. This data is then used to forecast weatherconditions, provide early warning signals for extreme weather events, and inform decision-making processes in various industries. The system we are discussing in this report uses two types of sensors - a humidity sensor and an air pressure sensor. Humidity sensors measure the amount of moisture in the air, while air pressure sensors measure the atmospheric pressure. The data collected from these sensors is then sent to a
cloud-based platform called ThinkSpeak using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
